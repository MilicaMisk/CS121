-- [Problem 4a]
-- Here we want to insert all distinct combinations of values that appear
-- in the raw web logs (resource, method, protocol, response).
-- So to do this, we will just insert a select statement
-- in which we group by those values to make them distinct.
INSERT INTO resource_dim(resource, method, protocol, response)

-- Here we want to insert all distinct combinations of values that appear
-- in the raw web logs (ip_addr, visit_val). So to do this, we will
-- just insert a select statement

-- [Problem 4c]
-- IMPORTANT - REQUIRES UDFS from date-udfs.sql
-- Now we will write our stored procedure.
-- This stored procedure just goes through every date/hour combo in the
-- passed-in interval, and for each combo, finds out if that combo is
-- a weekend and/or holiday using the UDFS from date-udfs.sql. Then it
-- inserts all that info into the table.
